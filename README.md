# WaterReminerApp
An android application which will help you to track down how much amount of water you need to drink and how much you are drinking (You just
need to register the water count in the app each time you drink water) and it will notify you to drink water based on your wake up and
sleep time. This app will show the complete analysis (week , month , yearly ) by using charts and graphs.
